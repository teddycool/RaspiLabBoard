# RaspiLabBoard
A circuit board and a python lib to make it easier to demonstarte and try things out on a RasberryPi. The board was made to try out AWS greengrass with a raspberry pi as a device with CAN capabillities but can of course be used for other purposes as well. 

The board is a raspberry pi hat that fits in to the IO.
